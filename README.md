A classic problem I always have is that once I figure out how to code something, it's easy to forget years later what I did. 
This GitHub is literally just a place where I can put all my random projects and completed tutorials so I can reference them whenever I need to.
This code is not impressive. If you are stalking me for resume items, you'll need to talk to Microsoft for those, cus all that cool code is not here.
